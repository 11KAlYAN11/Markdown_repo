# Sample Word Document

This example demonstrates how Microsoft Word documents can be converted to Markdown format.

## Introduction

This is a sample Word document created via Pandoc, demonstrating the conversion capabilities.

## Features

- Support for **bold** and *italic* text
- Support for code blocks
- Tables and lists

### Code Example

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello from Word!")
```

### Table Example

| Name | Age | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| John | 30  | Dev  |
| Jane | 28  | PM   |

## Converting Word Documents

When converting Word (.docx) documents to Markdown:
1. Formatting (bold, italic, etc.) is preserved
2. Tables are converted to Markdown tables
3. Lists are properly formatted
4. Code blocks maintain their structure
5. Images can be extracted (though this example doesn't include any)

### Tips for Best Results
- Use Word's built-in styles for headings
- Use proper list formatting in Word
- Use Word's table features rather than manual spacing
- Keep formatting simple and consistent
